                    p.
                        Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity.
                        These factors typically fall into three categories; 
                        What you know like passwords or PIN, what you have like smartphone or hardware, what you are like fingerprint or facial recognition.
                        By combining two factors from different categories, 2FA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. For example, when logging into an account with 2FA enabled, the user might first enter their password (knowledge factor) and then receive a one-time code on their smartphone (possession factor) via SMS, authenticator app, or email. Only by providing both the correct password and the one-time code can the user gain access.
                        2FA significantly enhances security by making it harder for attackers to access accounts, even if they have stolen or cracked a password.
                        It's widely used across various online platforms, including banking websites, email services, social media platforms, and more.
